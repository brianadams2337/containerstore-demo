**\[Account Area\]** A newly redesigned orders detail page has been introduced, offering a comprehensive view of order information.

The page is thoughtfully organized into sections, including:

- **Order Details**: Displays key information about the order.
- **Payment Details**: Provides a breakdown of payment methods.
- **Delivery/Billing Address**: Highlights the addresses associated with the order.

Additionally, the page features a detailed list of all ordered products, complete with in-depth information about each item.

At the bottom, a **Payment Summary** section presents a clear breakdown of the subtotal, shipping costs, and the final total.
