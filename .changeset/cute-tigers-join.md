**\[Basket\]** The display of delivery costs and their descriptions is now configurable directly within the SCAYLE Panel.
This allows for easier management of shipping information without requiring code changes.
Developers can access this configuration in the storefront using the useShopConfigCustomData.ts composable.
For full implementation details, see the [SCAYLE Resource Center](https://scayle.dev/en/storefront-guide/developer-guide/features/pages/basket#delivery-costs).
