**\[Promotions\]** Users can now apply and remove promotion codes directly in the shopping basket.
A new `SFBasketPromotionCodes.vue` component has been added, allowing customers to see their discounts applied without having to proceed to the checkout page first.
This replaces the current disclaimer on the basket page with a new `SFBasketPromotionCodes.vue` component.
This component builds on the latest enhancements to `@scayle/storefront-promotions@2.2.0` and enables users to add and remove promotion codes without necessitating entering checkout first.
