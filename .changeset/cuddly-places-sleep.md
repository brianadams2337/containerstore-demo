**\[Promotions\]** The following components have been enhanced to display both promotion and campaign information, such as campaign badge labels and reduction amounts:
`SFProductPrice`, `SFBasketSummaryReductions`, `SFBasketCardImage`, and `SFProductCard`.
Additionally, the `SFPromotionBadge` component has been renamed to the more accurate `SFDealBadge`.
