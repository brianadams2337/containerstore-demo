**\[CMS\]** Introducing `Scayle` - our new default static CMS provider.
Scayle delivers CMS pages as static content, streamlining the initial setup
process and eliminating unnecessary setup overhead (access tokens, space IDs, etc.)
when using the SFB for the first time. Scayle provider is meant only for development purposes
and will not be used for production deployments.
