**\[Architecture \]** Updated Nuxt to version `3.16.2`.
The primary change in this release is the upgrade to `unhead@2.x`, which necessitates small adjustments to both `nuxt.config.ts` and the usage of the `useHead` composable.
More details can be found on the Nuxt blog. [Nuxt blog](https://nuxt.com/blog/v3-16).
