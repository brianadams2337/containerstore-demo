'@scayle/storefront-application-nuxt': patch
---

**\[Promotions\]** Removed obsolete code related to inline gift selection display within `SFBasketAvailableItems.vue` (specifically the `isLastItemWithPromotions` function) and `SFBasketCard.vue` (the `show-free-gift-selection` prop).
This functionality had been unused since the Storefront Application 1.9.0 release.
