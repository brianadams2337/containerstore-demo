Implemented and replaced the whole search flow based on new `Search Engine V2`.
This includes:

- Overall UI and UX adaptations (header search input, suggestions dropdown, applicable filter indicator, search within mobile sidebar, etc.)
- Category suggestions that can have filters applied
- Product suggestions that are resolved only by entering the exact ID
- Refined flow when resolving the search term
- Search page usage only as a fallback
