**\[Header & Footer\]** We've introduced scheduled visibility for navigation items directly from the SCAYLE Panel.
The `useHeaderNavigation`, `useFooterNavigation`, `useSimpleHeaderNavigation` and `useSimpleFooterNavigation` composables now support a `visibleAt` parameter, allowing you to display or hide specific navigation links based on a set date and time.

For more details, see the [SCAYLE Resource Center Documentation](https://scayle.dev/en/developer-guide/shops/shop-navigation#time-schedule-visibility-of-navigation-items).
