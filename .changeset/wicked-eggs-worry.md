[Accessibility] Improved the heading structure within the `StoreVariantAvailability` component (used for displaying store variant availability) and account overview page (`account/index.vue`) to better reflect the informational hierarchy of the pages. This improves readability and accessibility for users, making it easier to understand the content. This involved adding new headings where necessary and adjusting existing headings to use the appropriate semantic level.
