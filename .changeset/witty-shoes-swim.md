[Navigation] Cleaned up and enhanced the `NavigationItem` test data. The `languages` field, which was no longer used, has been removed. Additionally, the `filters` property has been added to all category navigation items to facilitate more comprehensive testing of filtering functionality within the navigation. This change simplifies the test data and improves the accuracy of navigation-related tests.
