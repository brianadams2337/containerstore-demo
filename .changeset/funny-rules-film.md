**\[Architecture\]** The application's shop selector mode is now configurable via the `SHOP_SELECTOR_MODE` environment variable.
Set this variable before building your application to define the desired routing behavior for your international shops.
Please refer to the [documentation](<](https://scayle.dev/en/storefront-guide/developer-guide/features/internationalization/configuration#routing-configuration)>) for available modes.
