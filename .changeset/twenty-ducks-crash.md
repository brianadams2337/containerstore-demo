**\[Promotions\]** The `SFPromotionProgressWrapper.vue` component has been enhanced to support tiered promotions.
It now displays a progress bar with milestones, showing customers how close they are to unlocking different promotion tiers.
This new UI is also used for minimum-order-value promotions, which are now treated as a single-tier promotion for a consistent experience.
