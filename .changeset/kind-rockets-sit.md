[E2E] As part of the ongoing improvements to our multi-shop platform and the introduction of global API routing for path-based shops, we've updated our E2E test suite. Tests relying on RPC calls have been refactored to reflect the new, simplified API access. This ensures our tests remain comprehensive and effective in validating multi-shop platform functionality, minimizing the risk of regressions and ensuring a seamless experience for our customers across all shops.
