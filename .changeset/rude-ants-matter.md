New Product Listing Page
This release not only introduces a fresh look and feel of the Product Listing Page but also brings enhanced functionalities to improve the user experience:

- **Advanced filtering:** Improved filters to help users easily find the products they are looking for by dynamically updating filters and displaying only relevant filter options.
- **Intuitive category navigation:** Navigate seamlessly between nested and root categories.
- **Enhanced badges:** Badges highlight features, novelty, or other product attributes. This includes the "New In" badge for newly added products, custom badges for specific attributes (e.g., sustainability), and the "Already in Basket" badge to help users avoid duplicate selections.
  Moreover, the new page is built with a simple and easily customizable codebase, ensuring that it can be tailored to meet your specific needs.
  To learn more about the main components, data fetching and filtering logic, and customization opportunities, please refer to our [Storefront Guide](https://scayle.dev/en/storefront-guide/developer-guide/features/pages/product-listing-page).
