**\[Accessibility\]** To meet higher contrast ratio standards, core application colors have been updated.
This includes adjusting the primary red and a key gray value to improve readability, as well as unifying various text colors for a more consistent and accessible experience.

- Updated the primary red (`#E74B3A` → `#D1000A`).
- Adjusted a key gray (`#080808` → `#757575`).
- Unified text colors to use `text-gray-500`.
- Updated the 'Scroll to Top' button's border to `border-gray-500`.
