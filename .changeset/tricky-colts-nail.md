Improves UX of time box element on Promotions Banners. Adds a clear understanding of the time left for the promotion to end by providing a countdown time unit in the time box element. The format of the time box element is changed to be more user-friendly with (D : H : M) format, or (H : M : S) format if the promotion lasts less than 24H.
